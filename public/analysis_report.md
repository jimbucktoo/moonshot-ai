- Providing AI-driven evaluations that go beyond generic advice, offering actionable recommendations tailored to each startup’s unique context.
- Enabling efficient matchmaking between startups and investors, reducing the time and effort required for due diligence.
- Offering a scalable solution that can analyze thousands of startups simultaneously, making it accessible to a broader audience.

#### Unmet Needs of Investors
Investors often struggle to find reliable data and high-potential startups that align with their investment criteria. MoonshotAI addresses this by:
- Providing transparent and explainable evaluations that build trust in AI-driven insights.
- Offering exclusive access to high-potential startups, incentivizing investors to remain active on the platform.

#### Conclusion on Problem Uniqueness
MoonshotAI addresses several unmet needs in the startup ecosystem, particularly in the areas of startup evaluation, investor matchmaking, and scalability. While the problem of startup failure is well-recognized, the platform’s approach to solving it through AI-driven reasoning and matchmaking is novel and impactful.

Problem Uniqueness Score: 85/100
